## Reflection
This was a Three week long project built during my Engage Mentorship at Microsoft. Project involves technologies related to Face - Detection.

I Made this project first by integrating face api to detect person mood and features. After that I added new features in it like Recommended Songs , Muti Chat Feature , Movies Suggestions , Vlogs Suggestions etc .

There are many challenges I ran into during the making of this Project. One challenge is to make a real time multi chat using Socket.Io as this was my first time in Backened.

The Technologiies I used were NodeJs , Socket . Io , face-api.js , HTML , CSS ,Javascript .

Finally I want to thanks my Mentor Ekta Maam and entire Microsoft Team to help me completing this project .
Such Grateful ;-) .
